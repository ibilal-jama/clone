##Community Report Downloads
In partnership with Jama's Consulting team, we'd like to offer some custom reports for our customers. These reports were written with BIRT or Velocity, so if you are an on-premises customer and have experience with the appropriate platform, you can manipulate them to suit your needs. Please note that these reports come as-is. Jama Support will not assist with the use or modification of the reports.
 
###Notes:
On-premises customers of Jama: Follow the instructions in the user guide to install your report. There will be no harm done if you would like to install a report and try it out. If you have root or admin access to your instance, you can install the report. Make sure to configure the parameters as displayed in the image found in the report's folder. Some reports have multiple versions which cater to different databases, so pay close attention that you download the correct one.
 
Hosted customers of Jama: You will need to submit a support ticket to request we upload one of these offered reports as-is for you. Just submit a ticket indicating which report you would like to use and the URL of your instance. Note that a request to customize one of these templates would be considered a Services engagement. 

###Interested in having someone guide you through this process?
If you are interested in having a consultant tailor a report for you, build one from scratch or train you on how to write your own, please reach out to your Jama Account Manager to scope out a project. You can also access report templates that other customers have created. Hosted customers can upload any Word templates shared there to jamacloud, while on-premises customers can use any file they see fit on their instance.
